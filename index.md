# 👋 Hi, I'm Meritxell

Welcome to my personal portfolio.  
This site is currently under construction while I prepare a complete showcase of my work across:

- real-time C++ systems  
- embedded hardware and robotics  
- network engineering and automation  
- machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning  
- NLP and computer vision  
- cloud and big data (AWS, Spark, NoSQL)  

I’m building everything privately for now, and will publish the full portfolio once it’s polished and ready.
